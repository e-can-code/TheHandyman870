## 💡 Key Features

* **Dynamic Theme Engine:** Custom-coded dark/light mode toggle with persistence via `localStorage` to ensure user preferences are saved across sessions.

* **Conversion-Focused UX:** A proprietary "reveal" navigation system that prioritizes high-value user actions (Phone, Inquiry, Service Area) to maximize lead generation on mobile devices.
* **Serverless Form Handling:** Fully functional contact form integrated with **Formspree** for automated lead delivery without the overhead of a dedicated backend.
* **Fluid Typography:** Uses CSS `clamp()` functions and relative units for a consistent reading experience across all screen sizes.

### Frontend Architecture

### Logic & Interactivity
* **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+):** Zero-dependency implementation for gallery scroll logic, theme state management, and asynchronous UI reveals.

### Geospatial & Integrations
* **Leaflet.js:** Open-source JavaScript library for interactive map rendering.
* **OpenStreetMap API:** Primary tile server provider for geographical data.
* **Formspree:** Serverless API endpoint for handling POST requests and email automation.
